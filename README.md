# 2023 State Farm Coding Competition - Round 1

This is the stub project for the 2023 State Farm Coding Competition Round 1 in Java. This will be the same project you'll use once Round 1 begins. This is to just get you started -- making sure your computer is setup, that you are able to build and run the project (including unit tests), and getting familiar with the structure.

## Considerations

### Use Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Or else
